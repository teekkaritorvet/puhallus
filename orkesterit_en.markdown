## Retuperän WBK

%}

Retuperän WBK is the world’s best Espoo-based student fire brigade orchestra playing newer-French-horn-music. Anyone who has listened closely to their performance will surely have noticed that the orchestra’s sound is quite different from others. To achieve the right sonic atmosphere, the orchestra employs several methods, including what’s known as “playing properly wrong”, using instruments that have acquired the patina of time, and careful tuning. The chemically-enhanced horn section has managed to stand out with its unique sound, which can be inferred from the fact that the orchestra's calendar is filled with around a hundred annual fire-fighting events. You can enjoy the orchestra’s music, for example, on Wappu Eve at Ullanlinna Hill, at events hosted by private individuals or companies, as well as at their biennial grand concerts at the Töölönlahti Fire Station Hall.

  image_alt= 'Kuva RytmiHäiriköt Big Bandista'
%}

RytmiHäiriköt is the big band of the University of Eastern Finland. The band was founded in 1998, and from the very beginning it has been under the artistic leadership of Timo-Teemu Passi. From the get-go, the orchestra, with its distinctive style, stomped its way through rock-y paths, gradually evolving over the years from a ragtag ensemble into a gritty rock wind orchestra, and ultimately into a swinging, grooving big band. Their repertoire includes a mix of rock, swing, soul, and funk.

RytmiHäiriköt has attitude and an open-minded, unprejudiced approach to music. Above all, the band puts an emphasis on an atmosphere of openness between both the musicians and the audience.

Sohon Torwet (or more familiarly, the Philharmonic Wind Orchestra of the student nation for Satakunta and Tavastia/Häme (SHO) at the Finnish,  later nationalized, and now public university known as the University of Turku) is the best – and in many people’s opinion, the only – student wind orchestra at the University of Turku. Torwet have been bringing joy to the people for nearly 75 years, during which time they have established their role in Turku’s student culture.

Recognizable by their burgundy jackets and student caps, Torwet can be heard playing at the annual celebrations of many student organizations, on May Day at Taidemuseonmäkil, on the back of trucks driving through the city, and, of course, at their own traditional spring concer
