## Inclusivity & Safer Space Policy

All participating orchestras and their members are committed to following safer space principles, and we expect the same from everyone attending the event.

### The principles for a safer space
* Do not bully, mock, belittle, discriminate against or embarrass anyone by your words, actions or behaviour. Do not criticise appearance, gossip or repeat stereotypes. 
* Respect the physical space and integrity of others. Respect everyone's right to self-determination. All forms of one-sided sexual and gender suggestive behaviour are prohibited. Do not touch another person without permission, as you cannot know their boundaries without asking. Ask for space for yourself if necessary.
* Don't make assumptions based on appearance or behaviour. Do not make assumptions about others' sexuality, gender, family relationships, health, ethnicity or background. Respect the privacy of others and handle sensitive topics with respect. Accept differences. 
* Apologise if you have intentionally or unintentionally offended others. If your behaviour is interfered with, listen and discuss it. Take responsibility for your actions. 
* Be on everyone’s side. Maintain a relaxed atmosphere - it's OK to make mistakes and ask questions.
* A fun and safe event for all is created together! So be fair to others and everyone will have a good time.

### If you experience harassment or any other inappropriate treatment at Puhallus, do the following:
* Get involved if you see someone acting in violation of the principles for a safer space. 
* You can report the incident to the harassment contact person at [hary@teekkaritorvet.com](mailto:hary@teekkaritorvet.com) or for the peace officers in the event. If necessary, the person committing the harassment may be immediately removed from the venue.
* In case of criminal offences, call 112.
